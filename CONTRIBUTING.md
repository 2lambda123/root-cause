### Contributing Guide 

We are currently in the process of ironing out the legal stuff regarding doing our very first (strategic) open source project.

In particular we are still missing a contributor license agreement and automatic tooling to make sure PRs sign it.

If you would like to contribute in the meantime please contact us (benji@testim.io / bnaya@testim.io) directly.

## Technical Know-How

The project is a yarn workspace in order to build it:

```shell
# install dependencies
yarn
# run a package, for example the tester
cd packages/jest-tester-and-example
yarn test
```

Because the project is still pretty early if you want to contribute  but unsure how please contact us.

Pleae note our code of conduct. We take it seriously and we value diverse contributions and have a zero tolerance policy towards discrimination of any kind.
